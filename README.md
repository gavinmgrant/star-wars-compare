# Star Wars Compare

This is a React app compiled with Webpack that compares two Star Wars characters and determines if they have ever lived or were seen together using the public [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/api/).

## Criteria

* If they have shared a planet, starship or vehicle before.
* If so, state the charactersâ€™ names and movie(s) where that occurred (i.e. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were seen together in The Empire Strikes Back).

## Get Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run start`
3. Open the app in your browser here: `http://localhost:3000`
